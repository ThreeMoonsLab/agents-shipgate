# Static Host-Boundary Support

Agents Shipgate's zero-config boundary is a static configuration review. It
does not execute a coding agent, connect to MCP servers, call tools, import user
code, or verify that a host enforced the configuration at runtime.

`shipgate check` always evaluates every recognized changed repository surface.
The `--agent` option identifies the caller for routing and rerun commands; it is
not a host-coverage selector.

## Repository scope

Repository scope is deterministic and is the default for `check`, verification,
and `audit --host`.

| Adapter | Status | Repository surfaces | Static semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | first-class | `.codex/config.toml`, `.codex/hooks.json` | sandbox, approvals, network, MCP/app approvals, hooks |
| Claude Code | first-class | `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, Claude skills | permission modes/rules, sandbox/network, additional paths, MCP restrictions, plugins, hooks |
| Cursor | first-class | `.cursor/cli.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.cursor/rules/**` | Shell/Read/Write rules, MCP declarations, instruction trust roots |
| VS Code MCP | experimental | `.vscode/mcp.json` | MCP additions and changes; relevant changes fail closed |
| Shared/GitHub | first-class | `AGENTS.md`, Shipgate policies/state, skills, `.github/workflows/*` | instruction/gate weakening, workflow permissions and triggers |

A registered adapter reports `complete`, `not_applicable`, `partial`, or
`experimental` coverage. A relevant malformed, unreadable, binary, oversized,
external, symlinked, or unsupported input prevents a complete control result.
Path classification is case-insensitive so protected files cannot evade review
on macOS or Windows. Nested `.codex/**`, `.mcp.json`, and
`.github/workflows/**` copies remain protected for repository-wide drift and
trust-root review, even when the host only loads the root copy.

The boundary is intentionally fail-closed above the adapters' specialized
semantics. Most instruction, policy, skill, and workflow edits therefore route
to human review unless a dedicated rule can prove the change safe. This can be
noisier than the former Codex-only evaluator; it prevents an unclassified
cross-host trust-root edit from being reported as complete.

## Local-static audit scope

`shipgate audit --host --scope local-static` is an explicit local-machine
inventory. In addition to repository surfaces, it reads supported static user
and file/OS-managed sources such as Codex `$CODEX_HOME` configuration, Claude
Code user and file-based managed settings, the current workspace's static
Claude MCP entry, and Cursor's user CLI/MCP configuration.

Shipgate never runs dynamic policy helpers. Sources that cannot be reconstructed
deterministically are recorded as partial coverage rather than treated as
absent.

Both scopes explicitly exclude:

- transient permission prompts and approvals;
- command-line and environment overrides for a particular host invocation;
- host UI/session state;
- remote/server-delivered managed settings;
- runtime sandbox enforcement and operating-system behavior;
- the behavior or trustworthiness of an MCP server or tool.

The path and precedence fixtures are pinned to the vendor contracts for
[Codex configuration](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference),
[Claude Code settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings), and
[Cursor CLI permissions](https://docs.cursor.com/cli/reference/permissions).

## Reading the result

For local control, parse `shipgate.agent_boundary_result/v1` and switch on
`control.state`. Review `input_coverage`, `host_coverage[]`, `affected_hosts[]`,
`issues[]`, and `excluded_scopes[]` before relying on the result.

For inventory and drift, parse host-grants v0.2. An incomplete inventory cannot
be acknowledged as a baseline. A v0.1 baseline, scope mismatch, or incomplete
comparison is `incomparable`; `--fail-on-drift` exits 20 for both drift and
incomparability.
